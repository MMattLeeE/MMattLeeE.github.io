## Professional Self-Assessment

  Through out my time at SNHU I have come to learn about a variety of computer science related skill and practice implementing them. Various classes provided insights into general Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and data structures, and the usage of Databases. Collaboration in team environments were emphasized in classes that taught me how to use distributed source control systems like GitHub and EGIT. There was many online discussing through-out the courses to encourage communicating with fellow students. Communication with stakeholders was strongly emphasized all through out the program with copious reports and justification of work; applying agile techniques working in a team and submitting design documents for applications. Data structures and algorithms were covered in CS 260 with implementations of various sort and search algorithms. Various software engineering techniques and database systems were covered for web applications building a full stack application using Node.js, Express, Angular, and Mongo DB (MEAN stack), or mobile applications using the Android framework and Java. Working with REST APIs were covered with the use of python and the manipulation of data using various python frameworks like pandas and bottle.
	This Flutter application is a small portion of the knowledge gained from participating in SNHUs program. The Application showcases what was learned for Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Porting the existing code base for the Inventory app in Android to a new framework and language, Flutter and dart, highlights various software design techniques such as application state management. The addition of text search and hash maps to parse JSON data from REST API responses show an understanding of data structures and algorithms. The implementation of a cloud based real time database highlights proficiency in using modern database solutions and architectures. These various parts all fit into a cohesive final application that works together to provide an inventory tracking application.
